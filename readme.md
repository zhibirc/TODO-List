## About

_I'm a person who passionate about my own productivity. I want to manage my tasks and projects more effectively. 
And I need a simple tool that supports me in controlling my task-flow._

- I want to be able to create/update/delete projects `&&`
- I want to be able to add tasks to my project `&&`
- I want to be able to update/delete tasks `&&`
- I want to be able to prioritize tasks into a project `&&`
- I want to be able to choose a deadline for my task `&&`
- I want to be able to mark a task as "done" (THE END?)


## Features

**All from the above!**

In addition, it includes the following:

- sort tasks by their status;
- 2 color themes with trigger in UI and in application config;
- lock/unlock UI ("Read-Only" mode);

All tasks have three kinds of possible states:

- "_new_" (means a brand-new task);
- "_done_" (means you're a disciplined person and task is finished);
- "_undone_" (means for some reasons the task was canceled).

## Development

Serve locally:

```shell script
python3 -m http.server 3000
```
